# Task: if something goes wrong during the task agent execution (dk run) and i re-run the comand, it does not always resume the previous session/task - it will just pick a new todo task.
sometimes there can be multiple tasks stuck in doing and when i run it it will exit due to no tasks to execute.
it should reliable resume tasks and/or pick tasks up in doing - even if they were left in a bad state, e.g. locked, assigned etc - or at least give the user the option to resume a doing tasks with a timeout of 60 seconds that defaults to yes
