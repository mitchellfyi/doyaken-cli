## Context

Doyaken skills are authored as YAML files with prompt templates. The community is developing various patterns for skill authoring, packaging, and distribution that may offer better developer experience.

## Objective

Research Primer and community skill gists to understand how developers author, share, and install skills. Identify patterns for a `doyaken skills install` workflow.

## Sources

- https://gist.github.com/OmerFarukOruc/a02a5883e27b5b52ce740cadae0e4d60

## Research Questions

1. How does Primer approach skill creation and scaffolding?
2. What's the skill authoring developer experience like?
3. How are skills shared (git repos, gists, registries, URLs)?
4. What metadata do skills carry for discoverability?
5. How do they handle skill configuration and customization per-project?
6. What testing/validation exists for skills before publishing?

## Output

A list of concrete suggestions for improving doyaken's skill authoring experience, distribution mechanism, and installation workflow, formatted as potential task descriptions.
