## Context

Doyaken has a skills system in `.doyaken/skills/` with YAML-defined skills that map to prompt templates. OpenAI and the community have built more mature skills ecosystems with curation, discovery, and sharing.

## Objective

Research OpenAI's official skills repository and the VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills collection to understand skill definition formats, curation practices, and ecosystem patterns.

## Sources

- https://github.com/openai/skills
- https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated
- https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills

## Research Questions

1. What is OpenAI's skill definition format? How does it compare to doyaken's YAML skills?
2. How are curated skills different from community skills?
3. What skill categories exist and how are they organized?
4. How do skills declare dependencies, inputs, and outputs?
5. What skill composition patterns exist (chaining, nesting)?
6. How do they handle skill versioning and compatibility?
7. What's the skill discovery/installation workflow?

## Output

A list of concrete suggestions for improving doyaken's skills system, including format changes, new skills to add, and ecosystem features, formatted as potential task descriptions.
