## Context

Doyaken manages task execution with file-based state, locking, and assignment. Other tools have built more sophisticated agent workflow management patterns.

## Objective

Research obra/superpowers and rohitg00/pro-workflow to understand their approaches to agent task management, workflow orchestration, and developer experience.

## Sources

- https://github.com/obra/superpowers
- https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow

## Research Questions

1. What task management patterns do they use (file-based, DB, API)?
2. How do they handle multi-agent coordination?
3. What workflow primitives do they provide (parallel, sequential, conditional)?
4. How do they handle task dependencies and blocking?
5. What developer experience features stand out (CLI, TUI, notifications)?
6. How do they handle agent configuration and customization?

## Output

A list of concrete suggestions for improving doyaken's task management, multi-agent coordination, and developer experience, formatted as potential task descriptions.
