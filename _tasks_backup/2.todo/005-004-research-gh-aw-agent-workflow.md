## Context

Doyaken manages agent task execution with an 8-phase pipeline. GitHub's `gh-aw` (agent workflow) extension is a first-party tool for running AI agents against GitHub issues with structured workflows.

## Objective

Research gh-aw to understand its workflow model, GitHub integration, progress tracking, and agent orchestration patterns. Identify ideas for doyaken's GitHub sync and workflow features.

## Sources

- https://github.com/github/gh-aw
- https://github.github.io/gh-aw/

## Research Questions

1. How does it orchestrate agent workflows against GitHub issues?
2. What is its workflow definition format?
3. How does it track progress and report back to GitHub?
4. How does it handle failures, retries, and timeouts?
5. What agent backends does it support and how?
6. How does it handle permissions and safety controls?

## Output

A list of concrete suggestions for improving doyaken's GitHub integration, workflow execution, and progress reporting, formatted as potential task descriptions.
