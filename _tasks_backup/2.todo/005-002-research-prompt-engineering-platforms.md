## Context

Doyaken assembles prompts from templates with variable substitution (`{{TASK_ID}}`, `{{include:...}}`). Professional prompt engineering platforms offer more advanced features like A/B testing, analytics, and prompt pipelines.

## Objective

Research PromptLayer, Agenta, and Latitude to understand their prompt management, evaluation, and pipeline features. Identify patterns that could make doyaken's phase prompt system more powerful.

## Sources

- https://www.promptlayer.com/
- https://agenta.ai/
- https://latitude.so/

## Research Questions

1. How do they handle prompt pipelines/chains (compare to doyaken's 8-phase pipeline)?
2. What prompt evaluation/testing frameworks do they provide?
3. How do they track prompt performance and iterate?
4. What variable/template systems do they use beyond simple substitution?
5. Do they support conditional prompt sections or branching?
6. How do they handle multi-model prompt adaptation?

## Output

A list of concrete suggestions, improvements, and features to steal for doyaken's prompt system and phase pipeline, formatted as potential task descriptions.
