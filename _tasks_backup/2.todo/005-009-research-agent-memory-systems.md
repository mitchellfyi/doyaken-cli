## Context

Doyaken has a planned memory/learning system (task 004-008) but hasn't implemented it yet. SuperMemory provides a purpose-built memory layer for AI agents with MCP integration and Claude support.

## Objective

Research SuperMemory's architecture, API, and Claude integration to understand how persistent agent memory works in practice. Identify patterns for doyaken's planned memory system.

## Sources

- https://supermemory.ai/docs/intro
- https://github.com/supermemoryai/claude-supermemory

## Research Questions

1. How does SuperMemory structure and store memories (format, indexing, retrieval)?
2. How does the Claude MCP integration work?
3. What memory types do they support (episodic, semantic, procedural)?
4. How do they handle memory relevance scoring and decay?
5. How do they prevent memory pollution (wrong or outdated info)?
6. What's the memory lifecycle (creation, retrieval, update, deletion)?
7. How do they handle memory across different projects/contexts?

## Output

A list of concrete suggestions for doyaken's memory/learning system design, including storage format, retrieval patterns, and integration points, formatted as potential task descriptions.
