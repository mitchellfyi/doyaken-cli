# Doyaken

Standalone workflow automation for Claude Code. Autonomous ticket lifecycle, worktree isolation, coding conventions — works with any repo.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time global install
bash ~/work/doyaken/install.sh
source ~/.zshrc

# Bootstrap a repo (analyzes codebase with Claude Code CLI)
cd ~/work/myproject
dk init

# Start work on a ticket
dk 999
```

## Lifecycle

When you run `dk 999`, Doyaken creates an isolated git worktree and runs Claude through six autonomous phases. Each phase is a separate Claude Code session (`--fork-session`), so every phase starts with a fresh context window. The user is brought into the loop as a configured reviewer in Phase 6 — the autonomous loop waits for their review (and any other configured reviewers) and only closes the ticket once everyone has approved.

```
dk 999
  │
  ├─ Phase 1: Plan          Claude explores codebase, presents approaches, user approves
  ├─ Phase 2: Implement     TDD implementation, completeness verification
  ├─ Phase 3: Review        Adversarial code review (3 clean passes, fresh sessions)
  ├─ Phase 4: Verify        Format, lint, typecheck, test → commit + push
  ├─ Phase 5: PR            Generate description, create draft PR + attach reviewers
  └─ Phase 6: Complete      Mark ready, request reviews, monitor CI, address comments,
                            re-request reviewers each push, close ticket
```

| Phase | Skills | What Happens | User Action |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Plan | `/dkplan` | Reads ticket, explores code, presents 2-3 approaches, drafts plan | Approve plan |
| 2. Implement | `/dkimplement` | TDD per task, evidence table, completeness check | Clarify if needed |
| 3. Review | `/dkreview` + self-reviewer | Adversarial 4-pass review, 3 consecutive clean passes required | — |
| 4. Verify & Commit | `/dkverify` + `/dkcommit` | Quality gates, atomic conventional commits, push | — |
| 5. PR | `/dkpr` | PR description, create draft PR, attach `request`-type reviewers | — |
| 6. Complete | `/dkcomplete` + `/dkwatchci` + `/dkwatchpr` | Mark ready, request reviews, post `@mention` comments, monitor, address comments, close ticket | **Review the PR** |

### Audit Loop

Each phase (2-6) runs inside an audit loop. When Claude tries to stop, the Stop hook intercepts and injects a phase-specific quality audit. Claude must pass the audit before the hook authorizes completion.

```
Claude does work → tries to stop
  │
  ▼
Stop hook fires
  ├─ .complete file exists?  → allow stop, advance to next phase
  ├─ Max iterations reached? → allow stop (safety net)
  ├─ Below min audit passes? → BLOCK, inject audit prompt (no completion instructions)
  └─ At/above min passes?   → BLOCK, inject audit prompt WITH completion instructions
                                │
                                ▼
                              Claude follows audit → fixes issues → tries to stop → loop repeats
```

### Review Sub-Loop (Phase 3)

Phase 3 uses a **shell-managed sub-loop** on top of the standard audit loop. Each review iteration is a fresh Claude session (`--fork-session`), ensuring each adversarial review starts with a clean context. The shell tracks consecutive CLEAN results:

```
Shell starts review sub-loop (clean_passes=0)
  │
  ▼
Launch fresh Claude session with Stop hook (MIN_AUDITS=1)
  ├─ Claude runs /dkreview + 4-pass manual review + self-reviewer agent
  ├─ Builds merged findings inventory, fixes issues
  ├─ Writes review result signal: "CLEAN" or "FINDINGS:N"
  └─ Stop hook verifies, allows completion
  │
  ▼
Shell reads review result
  ├─ CLEAN → clean_passes++ → if ≥3: advance to Phase 4
  └─ FINDINGS → clean_passes=0 → fresh session → loop repeats
```

Each review iteration runs:
1. `/dkreview` — deterministic + 10-pass semantic review
2. Manual 4-pass review (Logic, Structure, Security, Holistic)
3. `self-reviewer` agent — independent adversarial review
4. Merged findings inventory → batch fix → re-verify

Default: 3 consecutive clean passes required. Override: `DOYAKEN_REVIEW_CLEAN_PASSES=5`.

Claude never learns how to signal completion on its own — the hook provides the `.complete` file path and promise string only after enough clean passes. This prevents premature completion.

### Session Timeout

Default: 24 hours for the entire `dk` run (all phases). Override: `DOYAKEN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=14400` (4h). Set to 0 to disable.

### Escalation

Even in autonomous mode, Claude stops and escalates to the user for:
- Secrets scan failures (never auto-fix security issues)
- Architectural review comments (need human judgement)
- 3+ failed attempts at the same fix (loop is stuck)
- Scope changes that affect other tickets

The user can always interrupt with Ctrl+C. Between phases, state is saved so `dk 999` or `dk --resume` picks up where it left off.

See [docs/autonomous-mode.md](docs/autonomous-mode.md) for full architecture.

## What needs `dk init`?

Most Doyaken features work immediately after `dk install` — no per-project setup required:

| Feature | Needs `dk init`? | Notes |
|---------|:---:|-------|
| `dkloop <prompt>` | No | Works in any git repo |
| `dkcomplete` | No | Works in any git repo with a PR |
| `/dkloop`, `/dkplan`, `/dkimplement`, etc. | No | Skills work in any Claude Code session |
| Hooks (guards, commit validation, ticket context) | No | Installed globally by `dk install` |
| Agents (self-reviewer) | No | Symlinked globally by `dk install` |
| `dk <number>` / `dk "description"` | No | Worktrees work in any git repo |

**What `dk init` adds:** It runs Claude Code CLI to analyze your specific codebase and generates project-tailored configuration in `.doyaken/`:

- **Quality gates** (`doyaken.md`) — discovers your format, lint, typecheck, and test commands from package.json, Makefile, CI config, etc. Without init, skills discover these at runtime (slower, may miss non-obvious commands).
- **Coding conventions** (`rules/`) — generates rule files from observed patterns (naming, file structure, error handling). Without init, Claude infers conventions from context each time.
- **Project-specific guards** (`guards/`) — creates guards for files that should never be committed (environment files, generated configs). Without init, only the universal guards (destructive commands, secrets, sensitive files) are active.
- **Integration config** — configures ticket tracker (Linear, GitHub Issues), Figma, Sentry, etc. Without init, skills skip tracker updates.

In short: everything works without init, but init makes it faster and more accurate by caching project knowledge.

### Per-project structure (created by `dk init`)

```
.doyaken/
  doyaken.md                 # Project-specific config (generated by Claude Code CLI)
  CLAUDE.md                  # @import of doyaken.md (auto-discovered by Claude Code)
  rules/                     # Coding conventions (generated from codebase analysis)
  guards/                    # Project-specific guard rules (generated)
  worktrees/                 # Worktree directories (created by dk)
```

Claude Code automatically discovers `CLAUDE.md` files in the project directory and all subdirectories (see [Claude Code docs: CLAUDE.md](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory#claudemd)). `.doyaken/CLAUDE.md` uses the `@doyaken.md` import directive to pull in the generated project config, so Claude sees it as part of the project context in every session.

## Internals

### Init (codebase analysis)

`dk init` creates a `.doyaken/` directory, then uses **Claude Code CLI** to analyze the codebase and generate project-specific configuration:

- **Quality gates** — discovers format, lint, typecheck, test commands from package.json, Makefile, CI config
- **Coding conventions** — generates rule files from observed patterns in the codebase
- **Guards** — creates guards for files that should never be committed (environment files, generated configs)
- **Integrations** — asks which integrations to use (ticket tracker, Figma, Sentry, Vercel, Grafana)

Flags:
- `--skip-analysis` — skip codebase analysis (still runs integration config unless `--skip-config` is also set)
- `--skip-config` — skip integration configuration (run `dk config` later)

To reconfigure integrations at any time: `dk config`

### Skills (immediate updates)

Skills are symlinked: `~/.claude/skills/ -> ~/work/doyaken/skills/`. Claude Code auto-discovers them as slash commands (`/doyaken`, `/dkplan`, etc.). Edit a skill file — change takes effect in the next Claude invocation.

All skills are **codebase-agnostic**. They discover the project's toolchain, conventions, and quality gates from the codebase itself rather than prescribing specific commands.

### Agents (immediate updates)

Agents are symlinked: `~/.claude/agents/ -> ~/work/doyaken/agents/`. Claude Code auto-discovers them and delegates tasks based on their descriptions.

### Hooks (immediate updates)

Hooks are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` with paths to Doyaken scripts (see [Claude Code hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)). Four hook types:

| Hook | Event | Script | Purpose |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| SessionStart | Session begins | `load-ticket-context.sh` | Load ticket context, detect focus areas |
| PreToolUse | Before Bash/Edit/Write | `guard-handler.py` | Block/warn on dangerous patterns |
| PostToolUse | After Bash (git commit) | `post-commit-guard.sh` | Validate commits via guards |
| Stop | Claude tries to stop | `phase-loop.sh` | Phase audit loop (when active) |

### Guards (immediate updates)

Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Universal guards (destructive commands, sensitive files, hardcoded secrets) ship with Doyaken in `hooks/guards/`. Project-specific guards are generated during `dk init` in `.doyaken/guards/`. See [docs/guards.md](docs/guards.md).

### Shell Functions (reload needed)

`dk.sh` defines `dk`, `dkrm`, `dkls`, `dkclean`, `dkloop`, and `doyaken`. After editing, run `dk reload` to apply.

## Confidence Scoring

Self-review findings include a confidence score (0-100). Only findings scoring >= 50 are reported:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | Certain — verifiable bug, missing guard |
| 75-89 | Highly confident — real issue with evidence |
| 50-74 | Moderately confident — likely issue |
| 0-49 | Filtered out — noise, pre-existing, or linter territory |

## Adding a New Project

1. `cd` into the repo
2. `dk init` — analyzes the codebase and generates `.doyaken/` config
3. Review the generated config in `.doyaken/` — edit rules and guards as needed
4. Commit `.doyaken/` to the repo (worktree artifacts are gitignored)

To re-run codebase analysis after significant changes:
```bash
claude -p "$(cat $DOYAKEN_DIR/prompts/init-analysis.md)"
```

## Configuration

### Environment

`DOYAKEN_DIR` — Override the install location (default: `$HOME/work/doyaken`). Set before running install or sourcing dk.sh.

### Guards

Project-specific guards are generated during `dk init` in `.doyaken/guards/`. You can also add guards manually — see [docs/guards.md](docs/guards.md) for the format and examples.

### Autonomous mode

Control via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DOYAKEN_LOOP_ACTIVE` | `0` | Enable the phase audit loop (set automatically by `dk`) |
| `DOYAKEN_LOOP_MAX_ITERATIONS` | `30` | Max iterations before forced stop |
| `DOYAKEN_LOOP_MIN_AUDITS` | Per-phase | Min audit iterations before completion authorized |
| `DOYAKEN_SESSION_TIMEOUT` | `86400` | Session timeout in seconds (24h). Set to 0 to disable. |
| `DOYAKEN_PHASE_N_MIN_AUDITS` | — | Per-phase override (e.g., `DOYAKEN_PHASE_2_MIN_AUDITS=5`) |
| `DOYAKEN_REVIEW_CLEAN_PASSES` | `3` | Consecutive clean review iterations required (Phase 3) |
| `DOYAKEN_REVIEW_MAX_ITERATIONS` | `10` | Max review iterations before advancing Phase 3 |
| `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES` | `3` | Max idle review cycles before Phase 6 escalates |
| `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` | `30` | Minimum wait window per Phase 6 cycle (minutes) |

### Reviewers

Phase 6 reads the `## Reviewers` section of `.doyaken/doyaken.md` to decide who to request reviews from. Two assignment types per row:

| Type | Mechanism | Use for |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `request` | `gh pr edit --add-reviewer <handle>` | Humans, GitHub Copilot, anything GitHub recognises as a reviewer |
| `mention` | `@<handle>` posted as a PR comment | AI agents that watch mentions but don't accept native review requests |

Defaults written by `dk config`:
- The current authenticated GitHub user (auto-detected via `gh api user`) as `request`
- `Copilot` as `request`

Edit `.doyaken/doyaken.md § Reviewers` directly or rerun `dk config` to change. After each push (review-fix commit), Phase 6 re-requests `request` reviewers and re-posts the `@mention` comment so reviewers know there's something new to look at.
