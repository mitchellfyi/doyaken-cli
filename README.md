# Dex

Dex turns Claude Code into a ticket-to-PR workflow runner. Give it a ticket
number or a task description and it plans the work, implements it in an isolated
branch/worktree, reviews it until clean, verifies it, opens a PR, watches CI and
review feedback, and cleans up when the PR is ready.

It is built for teams that want AI coding work to finish with the same discipline
they expect from a senior engineer: scoped plans, local quality gates, review
loops, evidence for UI changes, clean commits, and PR follow-through.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time install
bash ~/work/dex/install.sh
source ~/.zshrc
dx status

# In a repository you want Dex to understand
cd ~/work/myproject
dx init

# Start a ticket or free-form task
dx 1234
dx "add account export"
```

That is the normal path. `dx init` creates `.dex/` project context so future runs
know your stack, conventions, quality gates, reviewers, guards, and durable
repo memory.

## Why Use Dex

- **Less babysitting:** Dex advances through plan, implementation, review,
  verification, PR, and completion without needing a prompt at every step.
- **Higher trust:** Each phase has a Stop-hook audit. Claude cannot simply claim
  completion; it must satisfy the gate for the current phase.
- **Cleaner branches:** Work runs in `.dex/worktrees/` by default, keeping your
  main checkout usable while tickets progress independently.
- **Review before PR:** Phase 3 runs fresh full-scope review waves until the
  resolved clean-pass gate succeeds.
- **Real verification:** Dex discovers and runs the repo's format, lint,
  typecheck, generation, and test commands instead of assuming one toolchain.
- **UI evidence:** Browser-facing changes can capture before/after screenshots,
  Playwright traces, videos, console logs, and a PR-ready visual manifest.
- **PR follow-through:** Dex can mark a PR ready, request reviewers, watch CI and
  review comments, apply fixes, re-request review after pushes, and close the
  ticket when approved.

## How The Loop Works

```text
dx 1234
  |
  |-- Phase 1: Plan
  |     Explore the ticket and codebase, propose an approach, wait for approval.
  |
  |-- Phase 2: Implement
  |     Build with tests, capture UI evidence when needed, prove criteria are met.
  |
  |-- Phase 3: Review
  |     Run fresh review-wave CLI sessions until the change is clean.
  |
  |-- Phase 4: Verify + Commit
  |     Run quality gates, create atomic conventional commits, push the branch.
  |
  |-- Phase 5: PR
  |     Create the draft PR with description, reviewer routing, and visual handoff.
  |
  `-- Phase 6: Complete
        Mark ready, watch CI/reviews, address feedback, close the ticket, clean up.
```

The important piece is the audit loop. When Claude tries to stop, Dex's Stop hook
checks the phase state and injects the next required audit. Only a passing phase
can advance. Review waves have their own clean-pass counter: a wave that finds
and fixes anything writes `FINDINGS_FIXED:N`, resets the counter, and forces a
fresh full-scope review before Phase 4 can start.

## Common Commands

```bash
dx install                 # Install shell functions, hooks, skills, and tooling
dx status                  # Show global and project setup
dx init                    # Analyze the current repo and create .dex/
dx sync                    # Refresh durable repo memory and rules
dx 1234                    # Run the full lifecycle for a ticket
dx "task description"      # Run the full lifecycle for a free-form task
dx --no-worktree 1234      # Run the lifecycle in the current checkout
dxreviewloop               # Review current changes without the full lifecycle
dxcomplete                 # Resume PR completion for the current branch
dx provider current        # Show active Claude/Codex execution profile
dx tools bootstrap         # Install/refresh browser MCPs, docs MCP, and plugins
```

`dex` and `dexter` are aliases for `dx`.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed and signed in.
- A git repository.
- `jq` for settings merge/uninstall flows.
- Optional: Codex CLI if you want the `codex-subscription` provider profile.
- Optional: `shellcheck`, language toolchains, and test tools used by your repo.

Dex installs Playwright UI-capture tooling into `~/.claude/.dex-tools/` and
stores screenshots, traces, logs, and videos under `~/.claude/.dex-artifacts/`.
It does not commit those artifacts.

## Project Context

`dx init` creates:

```text
.dex/
  dex.md            Project config, gates, reviewers, integrations
  AGENTS.md         Imports dex.md for agent context
  CLAUDE.md         Claude Code compatibility pointer
  review-rules.md   Optional path-specific review focus
  rules/            Generated coding conventions
  guards/           Project-specific safety guards
  memory/           Durable repo memory
  worktrees/        Ephemeral Dex worktrees
```

Dex skills are codebase-agnostic. They discover local commands and conventions at
runtime, then use `.dex/` to avoid rediscovering stable project knowledge on
every run.

## Provider Profiles

Dex keeps Claude Code as the lifecycle harness because it relies on Claude Code
hooks, skills, plan mode, and same-session handoff. You can still route
substantive work through supported profiles:

- `claude-subscription` - direct Claude Code via Claude subscription auth.
- `codex-subscription` - Claude remains the harness while coding/review work is
  delegated through Dex's Codex wrapper using ChatGPT subscription auth.

```bash
dx provider list
dx provider use codex-subscription
dx provider doctor
```

Subscription-safe profiles strip API-provider environment variables from
launched subprocesses and require Dex-managed wrappers for delegated Codex work.

## Documentation

- [Autonomous mode](docs/autonomous-mode.md) explains phase hooks, state files,
  review loops, and watcher behavior.
- [Guards](docs/guards.md) covers hook-based safety rules.
- [UI capture](docs/ui-capture.md) covers screenshots, traces, videos, and PR
  visual evidence.

## Status

Dex is V1 software from Synthetic Industry. It assumes fresh V1 installs and does
not carry pre-V1 migration paths.
