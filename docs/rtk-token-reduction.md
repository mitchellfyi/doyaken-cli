# RTK Token Reduction Integration

Dex now bootstraps [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) as part of `dx install`,
`dx init`, `dx sync`, and `dx tools bootstrap`.

## Research Summary

RTK is a single Rust CLI that wraps common development commands and filters
their output before it reaches an agent context. Its upstream docs describe
60-90% token savings for common operations, prebuilt binaries for macOS/Linux,
and an agent hook model that rewrites Bash commands such as `git status` into
`rtk git status`.

The upstream Codex integration is instruction-based rather than hook-based:
Codex is told to prefix shell commands with `rtk`. Claude Code supports a
PreToolUse hook with `updatedInput`, so Dex can use RTK's own `rtk hook claude`
entrypoint there without adding a large RTK instruction block to every project.

## What Dex Installs

- A verified RTK binary, preferring an existing valid `rtk` on `PATH`.
- A Dex-managed fallback binary in `~/.claude/.dex-tools/rtk/bin/rtk`.
- A fail-open Claude Code hook at `hooks/rtk-claude-hook.sh`.
- A Codex global `RTK.md` plus an absolute import in `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`.

Dex verifies the binary with `rtk rewrite "git status"` before trusting it. This
avoids the known package-name collision with the unrelated Rust Type Kit binary
without depending on RTK's own hook-install diagnostics.

## Runtime Behavior

Claude Code Bash tool calls now run through Dex guards first. If a guard allows
the command, the RTK hook gets the same payload and may return an `updatedInput`
command. The wrapper prefixes rewritten commands with RTK's install directory in
`PATH`, so the generated `rtk ...` command still works when the agent shell did
not load `~/.local/bin`. If RTK is unavailable or fails, the wrapper exits
successfully and leaves the original command untouched.

Codex does not currently expose the same transparent Bash rewrite path through
Dex, so Codex receives compact global instructions. Those instructions prefer
RTK for commands where summarized output is enough and keep raw commands
available when exact output matters.

RTK's `gain` command may still warn that `rtk init -g` has not installed a hook,
because upstream RTK only recognizes a literal `rtk hook claude` settings entry.
Dex's hook is a wrapper around that same entrypoint so it can locate a
Dex-managed binary and fail open when RTK is unavailable. Use `dx status` or
`dx tools doctor` to check the Dex-managed RTK hook.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DX_RTK_ENABLED=0` | Skip RTK install, checks, and hooks. |
| `DX_RTK_BIN=/path/to/rtk` | Force Dex to use a specific RTK binary. |
| `DX_RTK_INSTALL_DIR=/path` | Override Dex's RTK install directory. |
| `DX_RTK_VERSION=vX.Y.Z` | Pin the RTK release downloaded from GitHub. |

## Manual Verification

This change was tested with an isolated temporary home directory and with the
real Dex tooling bootstrap.

- Isolated bootstrap installed RTK v0.42.0, created `.claude/settings.json`,
  wrote Codex `RTK.md`/`AGENTS.md`, and verified `rtk rewrite "git status"`.
- The Claude hook rewrote a Bash payload for `git status` into an RTK command
  and the rewritten command ran with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`.
- The fail-open path returned exit 0 with no output when RTK was unavailable.
- Real `dx tools bootstrap` installed RTK in `~/.claude/.dex-tools/rtk/bin/rtk`,
  linked `~/.local/bin/rtk`, refreshed Claude settings, and wrote Codex RTK
  instructions.
- `dx tools doctor`, `dx status`, `shellcheck`, `bash -n`, `zsh -n dx.sh`,
  `jq . settings.json`, and `git diff --check` passed.
