BLOCKED: Raw Codex CLI delegation is disabled while Dex is using Claude as a Codex-provider proxy.

Use `bin/dxcodex.sh` so Dex can enforce subscription-safe Codex flags, sandbox settings, and provider environment cleanup. This guard blocks raw Codex agent work such as `codex`, `codex exec`, `codex e`, `codex review`, direct `dx_provider_codex` helper delegation, literal variable-expanded and escape-decoded generated/heredoc/direct executable shell payloads, Python/Node/Ruby/Perl interpreter payloads that launch Codex, launch wrappers such as `nice`, `timeout`, `xargs`, and `find -exec`, package-runner forms such as `npx codex`, `npx -c "codex exec ..."`, and `npm exec --call "codex exec ..."`, and fail-closed shell execution from unresolved/unreadable script paths or unknown stdin/process-substitution producers.
