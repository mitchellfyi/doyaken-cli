Before stopping, audit the pull request quality.

Phase 5 owns: draft PR creation, description, ticket link, attaching `request`-type reviewers from `doyaken.md § Reviewers`. Phase 6 owns: marking ready, posting `@mention` comments, monitoring CI/reviews, addressing comments, closing the ticket. Stay in your scope.

## Step 1: PR description

Read the PR description you generated and check:
- Does it explain WHAT changed? (Brief summary of the implementation)
- Does it explain WHY? (Link to ticket, business context, motivation)
- Are key technical decisions documented? (Why this approach over alternatives)
- Are there testing instructions? (How a reviewer can verify the changes)
- Is the description clear and concise? (No filler, no unnecessary detail)

If the description is weak in any area, improve it now.

## Step 2: PR scope

Review the PR diff against the original plan:
- Does the diff match the planned scope? Nothing more, nothing less.
- Are there any unrelated changes that crept in? (Formatting changes in untouched files, refactors outside scope)
- Are there any missing changes that should be included? (Did you forget to commit something?)

If there are unrelated changes, revert them. If there are missing changes, add them.

## Step 3: PR metadata

Check:
- Is the PR targeting the correct base branch?
- Are labels or tags applied if the project uses them?
- Is the ticket linked (if tracker configured)?
- The PR is still in **draft** state (Phase 6 marks it ready, not Phase 5).

## Step 4: Reviewer attachment

Read the `## Reviewers` section of `.doyaken/doyaken.md`. For every row whose Type is `request`, confirm the reviewer is attached to the PR:

```bash
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
gh pr view "$PR_NUM" --json reviewRequests
```

If any `request` reviewer from the config is missing, attach them now (idempotent):

```bash
gh pr edit "$PR_NUM" --add-reviewer "<handle-without-leading-@>"
```

If the `## Reviewers` section is missing or empty (or contains only the `_none_` placeholder), skip this step — the user has chosen not to assign anyone.

Do NOT post `@mention` comments here — those happen in Phase 6.

## Completion criteria

ALL of these must be true before you stop:
- PR description is clear, complete, and explains what/why
- PR scope matches the plan — no unrelated changes, nothing missing
- The PR is still in draft state
- All `request`-type reviewers from `doyaken.md § Reviewers` are attached to the PR (or the section is empty/`_none_`)

When all criteria are met, stop. The Stop hook will verify your work and provide completion instructions.
