Before stopping, audit your work against the original prompt. Do NOT stop until every step below passes.

If you haven't already, read the implementation guardrails from `prompts/guardrails.md` — they inform what to look for in the review passes below.

## Step 1: Acceptance Criteria Extraction

Your original task prompt is reprinted above (under "Original Task Prompt"). If it is not visible, read it from the file path in your system prompt using the Read tool, or check `~/.claude/.doyaken-loops/` for a `.prompt` file matching your session.

List every distinct acceptance criterion as a numbered list — this list is your contract for all subsequent steps.

For each criterion, classify it:
- **Functional** — what the code must do
- **Non-functional** — error handling, edge cases, performance, security
- **Implied** — criteria not stated explicitly but necessary for correctness (e.g., input validation, cleanup on failure)
- **Contextual** — specific files, APIs, patterns, or conventions mentioned or referenced

If the prompt references external context (a ticket, a URL, a document), ensure you have incorporated it into the acceptance criteria.

Verify your understanding against the guardrails:
- Can you answer the five understanding-check questions from `prompts/guardrails.md`?
- Have you identified the failure modes and resource cleanup needs?

**Session classification:** Run `git diff --name-only` and `git status --porcelain`. If any production code files were created or modified (not just docs/config), this is a **code-change session**. Otherwise it is a **non-code session**. This classification determines whether /dkreview and the self-reviewer agent run in subsequent steps.

## Step 2: Self-Review via /dkreview (code-change sessions only)

**Skip this step if this is a non-code session.**

Run /dkreview on your changes (if you haven't already since your last code change).

Read the report carefully. Do NOT fix anything yet — record all findings for the inventory in Step 5.

## Step 3: Multi-Perspective Inventory

**CRITICAL: Do NOT fix anything during this step. Only find and record.**

Perform four manual review passes over ALL your changes, in addition to any /dkreview findings from Step 2. For each issue, record: `[INV-N] file:line | Pass | Severity | Description`

Reference `prompts/review.md` for the full criteria behind each pass.

### Pass A: Logic & Correctness

For each acceptance criterion from Step 1, trace the implementing code end-to-end:
- Happy path, failure paths, edge cases (empty/null/zero/boundary)
- Try to BREAK each function — construct inputs that cause failure, states that cause inconsistency
- Off-by-one errors, null checks, race conditions
- Missing error handling — swallowed errors, generic catch-alls, empty catch blocks
- Resource cleanup — are opened resources closed on both success and failure paths?

### Pass B: Structure, Design & Documentation

- Workarounds, hacks, TODOs, or hardcoded values?
- Unnecessary complexity or abstraction?
- Unused imports, dead code, commented-out code?
- N+1 queries, unbounded loops, performance anti-patterns?
- Does every new public function/method have a corresponding test?
- Non-obvious logic has a "why" comment? Complex regexes explained? Magic numbers named?
- New public APIs have doc comments?

### Pass C: Security

Review all changes for security gaps (reference `prompts/review.md` Pass C for full criteria):
- New endpoints/routes have appropriate authentication and authorization?
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API keys?
- No sensitive data in logs, error messages, or API responses?
- Input validated at system boundaries?
- Database queries use parameterized queries — no string interpolation?
- Secure defaults — features restricted by default, not permissive?

### Pass D: Holistic Consistency & Dependencies

Run `git diff` against the base branch and review ALL changes together:
- Naming, error handling, and logging consistent across all changed files?
- Patterns established in one file followed in all files?
- Code consistent with existing codebase conventions?
- If you changed a contract (type, API, schema), trace consumers up to 3 hops deep using `Grep` — are all consumers updated?

## Step 4: Independent Self-Reviewer Agent (code-change sessions only)

**Skip this step if this is a non-code session.**

Spawn the `self-reviewer` agent to get an independent review perspective. Provide:
- The acceptance criteria list from Step 1 (copy verbatim)
- The current branch name and base branch (from `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and the default branch)
- Which areas of the codebase have changed files (from `git diff --name-only`)

The agent reviews independently and produces its own findings report. Do NOT fix anything based on the agent's findings yet — they feed into the merged inventory in Step 5.

## Step 5: Merged Inventory Output

Merge findings from all sources into a single inventory. Deduplicate by file:line. Print the complete inventory:

```
## Findings Inventory

| # | File:Line | Source | Pass | Severity | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| INV-1 | ... | dkreview | A | high | ... |
| INV-2 | ... | manual | C | medium | ... |
| INV-3 | ... | agent | B | high | ... |

Total: N findings (X high, Y medium, Z low)
```

Source values: `dkreview`, `manual`, `agent`.
If /dkreview did not run (non-code session), omit that source.
If the self-reviewer agent was not spawned (non-code session), omit that source.

- If the inventory is **empty** → skip to Step 7.
- If **non-empty** → proceed to Step 6.

### Findings Hash (for stuck detection)

After building the inventory, compute and record a findings hash so the stop hook can detect stuck loops:

```bash
source "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/lib/common.sh"
FINDINGS_HASH=$(echo "<sorted list of INV-N descriptions>" | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-16)
echo "$FINDINGS_HASH" >> "$(dk_findings_file "${DOYAKEN_SESSION_ID:-$(dk_session_id)}")"
```

Replace `<sorted list of INV-N descriptions>` with the actual finding descriptions from your inventory, sorted alphabetically, one per line. If the inventory is empty, use the string "EMPTY".

## Step 6: Batch Fix and Holistic Re-verification

1. Fix all inventory items in severity order (high → medium → low).
2. After ALL fixes are applied:
   - **Code-change sessions:** re-run /dkreview on the **full scope** (not just modified files).
   - Re-run your manual passes (Step 3) on the **entire change set** — fixes can regress untouched files.
   - Re-spawn the self-reviewer agent to verify fixes against the FULL change set. **Maximum 3 total agent spawns** (including the initial spawn in Step 4).
3. If new findings → add to inventory, fix, and re-verify. **Maximum 3 cycles.**
4. Do NOT proceed with known findings. If findings persist after 3 cycles, continue fixing — the iteration limit in the stop hook is the only safety valve, not this step.

## Step 7: /dkverify Quality Pipeline (code-change sessions only)

**Skip this step if this is a non-code session.**

Run /dkverify to execute the full quality verification pipeline:
1. Format — auto-fix formatting issues
2. Lint — auto-fix where possible, manual fix where not
3. Type-check — fix type errors
4. Code generation — if applicable, run generators and check for uncommitted changes
5. Test — run the full test suite

If any check fails, fix and re-run (max 3 retries per check type). After 3 failures on the same check, escalate to the user.

All checks must pass before proceeding to Step 8.

## Step 8: Evidence Table

For each acceptance criterion from Step 1, fill in the evidence table:

```
## Evidence

| # | Criterion | Implementation (`file:line`) | Test (`test:line`) | Status |
|---|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------|---------|
| 1 | ... | `file:line` | `test-file:line` | MET |
| 2 | ... | `file:line` | — | NOT MET |
```

**Rules:**
- Implementation evidence must be a specific `file:line` in production code.
- Test evidence must be a specific test name or `test-file:line`. For non-code acceptance criteria (research, analysis, documentation), write `N/A` with a brief justification.
- Prose claims ("I verified this") are NOT evidence. Cite specific locations.
- Any NOT MET entry blocks completion — go back and implement/test it.

## Step 9: `.doyaken/` Freshness (if applicable)

If the project has a `.doyaken/` directory, check whether your changes introduced:
- New dependencies or tooling changes → `.doyaken/doyaken.md` updated?
- New code patterns or conventions → relevant `.doyaken/rules/*.md` updated?
- New security boundaries or sensitive paths → `.doyaken/guards/` updated?

If updates are needed but missing, make them now.

## Completion Gate

Only output PROMPT_COMPLETE when ALL of these are true:
- Every acceptance criterion from Step 1 has status MET in the evidence table (Step 8)
- The findings inventory from your last re-verification (Step 6) is empty
- **Code-change sessions:** /dkreview result is PASS (not PASS WITH WARNINGS or NEEDS ATTENTION), AND you have run /dkreview AFTER your most recent code change
- **Code-change sessions:** /dkverify passes — format, lint, typecheck, tests all green (Step 7)
- Any needed `.doyaken/` updates are applied (Step 9)
- You have re-verified AFTER your most recent change of any kind

Do NOT output PROMPT_COMPLETE if any acceptance criterion is NOT MET, any findings remain, /dkreview is not PASS (for code changes), or /dkverify has failures (for code changes). Fix first, then re-audit from Step 3.

Before outputting PROMPT_COMPLETE, write the completion signal file:

```bash
source "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/lib/common.sh" && touch "$(dk_complete_file "${DOYAKEN_SESSION_ID:-$(dk_session_id)}")"
```
