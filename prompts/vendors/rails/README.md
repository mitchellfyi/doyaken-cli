# Ruby on Rails Prompts

Rails 7/8 patterns, design principles, and best practices.

## Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [patterns.md](patterns.md) | Rails design patterns and service objects |
| [api.md](api.md) | API development best practices |
| [performance.md](performance.md) | Performance optimization techniques |

## When to Apply

Use these prompts when:
- Building Rails applications
- Implementing service objects and patterns
- Creating REST APIs with Rails
- Optimizing Rails performance

## Rails Philosophy

### Convention over Configuration
Follow Rails conventions to reduce decisions and boilerplate.

### Fat Model, Skinny Controller
Business logic belongs in models, controllers just orchestrate.

### Modern Evolution
Service objects, form objects, and query objects for complex logic.

## Key Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Service Objects | Complex business logic |
| Form Objects | Multi-model forms |
| Query Objects | Complex database queries |
| Presenters | View-specific formatting |
| Policy Objects | Authorization logic |
