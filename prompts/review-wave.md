# Review Wave

One `/dxreviewloop` iteration reviews the caller-supplied scope. This is usually
the full current change set; when no change set exists, it is the entire tracked
codebase. The outer loop sets the required consecutive `CLEAN` waves from the
resolved profile: `light`, `standard`, or `thorough`.

## Rules

- Review the full caller-supplied scope every wave.
- Build the context pack before broad exploration or domain-specific review.
- Run deterministic checks before semantic review.
- The review wave runs in one CLI session.
- Do not commit, push, create branches, create or update PRs, or poll reviewers.
- Do not create or switch worktrees or branches. A review wave runs in the
  current checkout; only `dk <ticket-or-description>` owns lifecycle setup.
- Acceptance criteria come only from the current caller; otherwise use `N/A`.
- `CLEAN` means zero verified findings and zero fixes in this wave.

## Concise Style

Write for transfer, not narration. Prefer paths, symbols, command summaries,
file:line evidence, and JSON lines. Omit greetings, status prose, repeated rules,
passing logs, unchanged code, and duplicate findings. Keep command output in the
context pack summarized unless the exact text is evidence.

Tool output: prefer `rg`, `git diff --name-only`, `git diff --stat`, and
`git diff --numstat` for orientation. Use full file reads only when needed to
verify behavior; quote only the evidence lines in reports.

## Results

- `CLEAN` - no verified findings and no fixes.
- `FINDINGS_FIXED:N` - N verified findings fixed and rechecked.
- `FINDINGS:N` - N verified findings remain.
- `BLOCKED:reason` - required tooling, context, or user judgment is missing.
- `ESCALATE_THOROUGH:reason` - the current profile is too shallow.

Only `CLEAN` increments the outer clean counter. Every other result resets it.

## 1. Context Pack

Create or refresh the context pack in global Dex state:

```bash
source "${DEX_DIR:-$HOME/work/dex}/lib/common.sh"
SESSION_ID="${DEX_SESSION_ID:-$(dx_session_id)}"
REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE="$(dx_review_context_file "$SESSION_ID")"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE")"
```

First write a non-empty skeleton with supplied diff/stat/name commands, changed
files, profile, and acceptance criteria or `N/A`; then verify it:

```bash
test -s "$REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE"
sed -n '1,80p' "$REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE"
```

Add concise sections:

- file groups: production, tests, docs, generated, config, CI/devops, UI, API,
  data/schema, shell/hook, other
- per-file risk: high, medium, low
- relevant project context and scoped active memory entries
- discovered deterministic checks
- dependency impact: exports, schemas/contracts, direct consumers, recent fixes
- accepted debt/risk not to re-raise

## 2. Deterministic Checks

Run available scoped checks first: format/check, lint, typecheck, targeted tests,
generated-code freshness, shell syntax/`shellcheck`, and CI/config validation
when relevant. Mechanical fixes make the wave non-`CLEAN`.

## 3. Issue Harvest

Collect all candidate issues before fixing anything.

- `light`: core domain sweep across correctness, security, contracts, tests, and
  architecture.
- `standard`: core sweep plus targeted domain sweeps for concrete changed
  surfaces.
- `thorough`: all domain sweeps across the full caller-supplied scope.

The wave orchestrator covers all requested domains in the current CLI session.
Construct breaking inputs, trace direct callers, and filter speculation.

Full domain roster in `thorough`: correctness, security, contracts, tests,
architecture, frontend, devops, performance, and observability.

Targeted domain sweeps in `standard`:

- trust boundary/secrets/auth -> security
- public API/schema/config/CLI contract -> contracts
- acceptance/regression coverage -> tests
- abstraction/module boundary -> architecture
- UI/browser/client state/routing/accessibility -> frontend
- CI/deploy/shell/hooks/package scripts/infra -> devops
- hot path/query/cache/large data/rendering -> performance
- logs/metrics/traces/health/audit trails -> observability

If the current session cannot review a required domain with enough confidence,
write `ESCALATE_THOROUGH:reason` for depth gaps or `BLOCKED:reason` for missing
local tooling/context.

Candidate output must be `NO_FINDINGS`, `N/A`, `ESCALATE_THOROUGH:reason`, or
JSON lines:

```json
{"id":"domain-1","domain":"correctness","severity":"high|medium|low","confidence":95,"file":"path","line":123,"introduced_by_change":true,"evidence":"exact behavior checked","trigger":"specific input/state/request/command","suggested_fix":"concrete fix","verification":"command/check"}
```

Report only confidence >= 50, cite exact file/line unless cross-file evidence
requires multiple paths, and filter style-only nits unless project rules require
them.

## 4. Verification

Run an explicit verifier pass over the candidate inventory. Deduplicate by root
cause, re-read cited code, check project context and accepted debt, reject
weak/stale evidence, confirm change relevance, and normalize severity.

Only verified findings may drive fixes. If `ESCALATE_THOROUGH` survives
verification, write it instead of fixing.

## 5. Batch Fix

If verified findings exist:

1. Fix all verified findings in severity order.
2. Keep fixes scoped to this change set and directly impacted callers.
3. Re-run affected deterministic checks.
4. Re-run targeted review for changed surfaces and impacted callers.
5. Repeat once if new verified findings appear; then use
   `prompts/failure-recovery.md`.

Write `FINDINGS_FIXED:N` when all verified findings were fixed and rechecked.
Never write `CLEAN` after applying a fix in the same wave.

Do not stop after merely finding or reporting verified issues. `FINDINGS:N` is
allowed only when verified findings remain after a concrete local fix attempt is
blocked, unsafe, or requires user judgment; include the residual reason in the
context pack and final report.

## 6. Result Signal

```bash
source "${DEX_DIR:-$HOME/work/dex}/lib/common.sh"
SESSION_ID="${DEX_SESSION_ID:-$(dx_session_id)}"
echo "<result>" > "$(dx_review_result_file "$SESSION_ID")"
FINDINGS_HASH=$(printf '%s\n' "<sorted verified finding descriptions or EMPTY>" | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-16)
echo "$FINDINGS_HASH" >> "$(dx_findings_file "$SESSION_ID")"
```

Final output:

```markdown
