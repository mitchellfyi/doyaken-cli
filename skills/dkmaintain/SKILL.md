# Skill: dkmaintain

Run the Doyaken background maintenance workflow from inside an agent session.

## When To Use

- The user invokes `/dkmaintain`.
- The user asks for a maintenance scout, nightly/background maintenance, or a
  Doyaken maintenance PR response.
- A GitHub workflow or CLI invocation asks for `dk maintain` behavior.

## Contract

Use the CLI wrapper for all execution. From the repo root, run:

```bash
bash "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/bin/maintain.sh" <arguments>
```

The wrapper owns worktree isolation, dry-run mutation detection, GitHub token
boundaries, branch/PR publication, structured response publication, and reviewer
requests. Do not manually implement write-capable maintain behavior from inside
the skill unless the CLI is unavailable and the user explicitly accepts
report/artifact-only output.

Read and follow `prompts/maintain.md` when you are the provider launched by the
wrapper. That prompt is the source of truth for:

- report/propose/fix-scoped modes;
- risk-surface selection;
- deterministic checks before semantic review;
- draft PR gating;
- Copilot reviewer normalization;
- event-driven PR feedback response.

## Arguments

Forward user-provided arguments into the prompt contract:

- `--mode report|propose|fix-scoped`
- `--nightly`
- `--focus <domain-or-path>`
- `--since <ref|date>`
- `--budget-minutes <n>`
- `--command-timeout-seconds <n>`
- `--max-surfaces <n>`
- `--max-prs <n>`
- `--no-sync`
- `--no-pr`
- `--dry-run`
- `--include-working-tree` (report/dry-run evidence only)
- `install-workflow [--force]`
- `respond --pr <number> [--event <issue_comment|pull_request_review|pull_request_review_comment|manual>] [--dry-run]`

Provider sessions do not receive GitHub write credentials through environment
variables or normal GitHub CLI config. In write-capable modes, prepare verified
local changes and report artifacts; `bin/maintain.sh` or the workflow publish
job publishes branches, draft PRs, Copilot review requests, pushes, and response
comments after the provider exits.

For `respond`, write PR-level response notes to the invocation's `response.md`
path, and write inline review-comment outcomes to `inline-replies.jsonl` as JSON
lines with `comment_id` and optional artifact-only context. Do not post GitHub
comments directly from the provider session. The wrapper publishes deterministic
public summary/reply text rather than copying provider-authored free text.

## Output

End with the maintenance report described in `prompts/maintain.md`. If files
changed, list each changed path, why it changed, and which verification command
passed after the change.
