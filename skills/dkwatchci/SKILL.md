# Skill: dkwatchci

Monitor CI checks after a PR is marked ready for review. Diagnose and fix failures.

## When to Use

- Scheduled via `/loop 2m /dkwatchci` from `/dkpr` after `gh pr ready`
- Can also be invoked manually for a one-off CI check

## How It Works

Each invocation is a **single check cycle** — `/loop` handles the scheduling. The session context carries state between invocations naturally.

## Steps

### 1. Get PR Info

```bash
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
```

### 2. Check CI Status

```bash
gh pr checks $PR_NUM
```

Parse each check: name, status (pending/pass/fail), URL.

### 3. Evaluate and Act

**All checks pass:**
1. Cancel the CI monitoring loop: ask to cancel the `/dkwatchci` loop, or use `CronDelete` with the job ID.
2. Report:
   - Total checks: X
   - Time to green (if known)
   - Any flaky tests observed
3. If `/dkwatchpr` loop is also done (all reviews approved, no unresolved comments), proceed to `/dkcomplete`.

**Any checks still pending:**
- Do nothing. Wait for the next loop invocation.

**Any checks failed:**
- Fetch logs and diagnose:
  ```bash
  gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
  ```
- Diagnose the failure from the logs. Common categories:
  - **Formatting/linting** — run the project's formatter/linter locally, commit, push
  - **Type errors** — run the type checker locally, fix errors, commit, push
  - **Test failures** — run the specific failing test locally, diagnose, fix, commit, push
  - **Code generation drift** — run the project's code generator, commit if changes, push
  - **Dependency issues** — check lockfile freshness, install, commit if changes, push
  - **Secrets scan** — **STOP IMMEDIATELY.** Cancel all loops. Alert the user. Do not auto-fix.
  - **Infrastructure failure** (Docker pull timeout, OOM in CI) — suggest `gh run rerun <id> --failed` or escalate
  - **Flaky tests** — if the same test fails intermittently with different error messages or passes on local rerun, treat it as a flaky test. On the first occurrence, retry once via `gh run rerun <id> --failed`. If it fails again on the same test, escalate to the user with the test name and both failure outputs rather than attempting code fixes.
- After fixing:
  1. Verify the fix locally (run the specific check).
  2. Commit with `fix(ci): <description>`.
  3. Push — triggers a new CI run.
  4. Wait for the next loop invocation to check the new run.

### 4. Escalation

- **Max 3 fix attempts per check.** After 3 failures on the same check, cancel the loop and escalate to the user with:
  - The check name and URL
  - What was tried
  - The error output
- **Secrets scan failure**: Cancel all loops. Escalate immediately. Credential rotation may be needed.
- **Infrastructure failure**: Suggest `gh run rerun <id> --failed` or escalate.

## Timeout

The monitoring loop should be set up alongside a **one-shot 30-minute timeout** via `/dkpr` Step 7. If checks are not all green after 30 minutes, the timeout fires, cancels all monitoring loops, and escalates to the user with a status report.

## Notes

- CI only runs after `gh pr ready` — draft PRs do not trigger CI.
- A push during CI triggers a new run; the old run is cancelled automatically.
- Some checks only run when specific paths change (check the project's CI configuration).
