# Skill: dkcomplete

Phase 6 of the autonomous lifecycle. Marks the PR ready, requests configured reviewers, posts `@mention` comments, monitors CI and reviews, addresses comments via `/dkprreview`, and closes the ticket once everything is green and approved.

This skill runs as a **cycle loop** driven by `prompts/phase-audits/6-complete.md`. The Stop hook re-injects the audit prompt every iteration; each cycle waits at least `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` minutes before checking outcomes. Bounded by `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES` (default 3) before escalating.

## When to Use

- Phase 6 of the autonomous lifecycle (invoked by `dk` after Phase 5)
- Standalone via the `dkcomplete` shell command (recovery / non-`dk` PRs)

## Steps

### 1. Read Reviewer Config

Read the `## Reviewers` section of `.doyaken/doyaken.md`. Parse rows into two lists:
- `REQUEST_REVIEWERS` — rows where Type is `request`
- `MENTION_REVIEWERS` — rows where Type is `mention`

Strip leading `@` from handles before passing to `gh pr edit --add-reviewer`. Keep the `@` for `@mention` comments.

If the section is missing, contains only the `_none_` placeholder, or both lists are empty, log a notice and skip the reviewer-related steps (the user has chosen not to assign anyone).

### 2. Initial Setup (only on the very first invocation)

Check whether `dk_complete_state_file` exists. If it does NOT exist, perform setup. If it DOES exist, setup ran in a prior iteration — skip to Step 3.

(Gating on the state file rather than on the cycle counter prevents setup from re-running on every audit iteration during the first wait window — the cycle counter doesn't increment until after the window matures.)

When setup runs:

1. **Mark the PR ready** if it's still a draft:
   ```bash
   PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
   PR_DRAFT=$(gh pr view --json isDraft -q .isDraft)
   [[ "$PR_DRAFT" == "true" ]] && gh pr ready "$PR_NUM"
   ```

2. **Re-sync request reviewers** (idempotent):
   ```bash
   for h in "${REQUEST_REVIEWERS[@]}"; do
     gh pr edit "$PR_NUM" --add-reviewer "${h#@}"
   done
   ```

3. **Post mention comment** (single comment listing all `mention` reviewers):
   ```bash
   if [[ ${#MENTION_REVIEWERS[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
     handles=$(printf '%s ' "${MENTION_REVIEWERS[@]}")
     gh pr comment "$PR_NUM" --body "Requesting review from ${handles}— please take a look."
   fi
   ```

### 3. Launch Monitoring Loops

`/loop <interval> <slash-command>` runs a slash command on a recurring interval in the background. Launch CI and review watchers if not already running:

```
/loop 2m /dkwatchci
/loop 5m /dkwatchpr
```

These check status, fix CI failures, address review comments via `/dkprreview`, and cancel themselves when their respective conditions are met (CI green / all reviews approved).

### 4. Wait Window

Each cycle waits at least `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` minutes (default 30) between outcome checks. You don't sleep — you just stop, and the Stop hook re-injects the audit on the next iteration. The audit checks elapsed time and only authorizes outcome evaluation once the window has elapsed.

### 5. Outcome Evaluation (after wait window)

Check overall PR state:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR_NUM"
gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$PR_NUM/reviews
```

- **All CI green AND all configured `request` reviewers approved** → proceed to Step 6 (final verification + close).
- **New commits were pushed** (e.g., `/dkprreview` addressed comments) → re-request reviewers and re-post the mention comment so reviewers know there's something new. Increment cycle, reset wait window.
- **Cycle was idle** (no new commits, no new approvals) → increment cycle. If `cycle_count >= DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES`, escalate to user; otherwise keep waiting.
- **Hard escalation** (3 same-check CI fails, scope change requested, secrets failure, architectural disagreement) → stop and escalate immediately with cited evidence.

### 6. Final Verification

Once Case A in Step 5 is met:

1. **CI**: All checks green (`gh pr checks $PR_NUM` reports all pass).
2. **Reviews**: All `request` reviewers approved, no unresolved comments.
3. **Mention reviewers**: Best-effort — if a `mention` reviewer commented with an actionable concern, it should already have been addressed by `/dkprreview`. The mention reviewers don't gate completion via review state.
4. **Tasks**: All implementation tasks marked completed.

If any condition is not met, return to Step 5 (do not advance to closure).

### 7. Update Ticket

Mark the ticket as Done via the configured tracker (see `doyaken.md § Integrations`). Add a final summary — what was implemented, key decisions, follow-up work. Skip if no tracker configured — the PR is the record.

### 8. Print Summary

```
Ticket: <id> — <title>       (or "No ticket — <branch name>")
URL:    <ticket-url>          (if available)
PR:     <pr-url>
Status: Work complete — awaiting merge (user's decision)

Files changed: X
Lines: +Y / -Z
Commits: N (including N_review review-fix commits)
Tests: M new test cases

Reviews:
  - <reviewer>: <status> (N comments addressed)
  ...

CI: All checks green (X/X passed)
Cycles: <cycle_count>
```

### 9. Signal Completion

After all verification passes and the summary is printed, stop. The Stop hook authorizes completion via the standard `.complete` mechanism — emit `DOYAKEN_TICKET_COMPLETE` only when the hook tells you to.

## Notes

- Do not merge the PR — that's the user's decision (autonomous merging is intentionally out of scope).
- If follow-up work was identified during implementation, mention it in the summary but do not create new tickets unless asked.
- The ticket should be marked "Done" (if a tracker is available) once CI and reviews are green; the actual merge happens when a maintainer accepts the PR.
- Hard escalations (secrets, scope conflict, architectural disagreement, 3+ CI failures on the same check) stop the loop and surface a structured escalation to the user — never auto-resolve these.
