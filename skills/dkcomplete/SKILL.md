# Skill: dkcomplete

Phase 6 of the autonomous lifecycle. Marks the PR ready, requests configured reviewers, posts `@mention` comments, monitors CI and reviews, addresses comments via `/dkprreview`, and closes the ticket once everything is green and approved.

This skill runs as a **cycle loop** driven by `prompts/phase-audits/6-complete.md`. The Stop hook re-injects the audit prompt every iteration; each cycle waits at least `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` minutes before checking outcomes. Bounded by `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES` (default 3) before escalating.

## When to Use

- Phase 6 of the autonomous lifecycle (invoked by `dk` after Phase 5)
- Standalone via the `dkcomplete` shell command (recovery / non-`dk` PRs)

## Autonomy Contract

Phase 6 runs unattended until CI is green and configured reviewers approve, or
until an explicit escalation condition is hit. Do not ask the user whether to
continue between wait cycles. Waiting for CI/reviewers is handled by the Stop
hook cycle loop and configured `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES`.

## Steps

### 0. Resume Phase 6 Watchers

`/dkcomplete` is the explicit signal to resume autonomous Phase 6 monitoring. Clear any pause left by a direct user prompt before launching `/dkwatchci` or `/dkwatchpr`:

```bash
source "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/lib/common.sh"
SESSION_ID="${DOYAKEN_SESSION_ID:-$(dk_session_id)}"
dk_clear_watch_pause "$SESSION_ID"
```

### 1. Read Reviewer Config

Read the `## Reviewers` section of `.doyaken/doyaken.md`. Parse rows into two lists:
- `REQUEST_REVIEWERS` — rows where Type is `request`
- `MENTION_REVIEWERS` — rows where Type is `mention`

Normalize request reviewer handles with `dk_maintenance_normalize_reviewer`
before passing to `gh pr edit --add-reviewer`. This strips leading `@` from
normal usernames but preserves GitHub CLI's special `@copilot` reviewer value.
Keep the original `@` form for `@mention` comments.

If the section is missing, contains only the `_none_` placeholder, or both lists are empty, log a notice and skip the reviewer-related steps (the user has chosen not to assign anyone).

### 2. Initial Setup (only on the very first invocation)

Check whether `dk_complete_state_file` exists. If it does NOT exist, perform setup. If it DOES exist, setup ran in a prior iteration — skip to Step 3.

(Gating on the state file rather than on the cycle counter prevents setup from re-running on every audit iteration during the first wait window — the cycle counter doesn't increment until after the window matures.)

When setup runs:

1. **Mark the PR ready** if it's still a draft:
   ```bash
   PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)
   PR_DRAFT=$(gh pr view --json isDraft -q .isDraft)
   [[ "$PR_DRAFT" == "true" ]] && gh pr ready "$PR_NUM"
   ```

2. **Re-sync request reviewers** (idempotent):
   ```bash
   source "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/lib/common.sh"
   for h in "${REQUEST_REVIEWERS[@]}"; do
     reviewer=$(dk_maintenance_normalize_reviewer "$h")
     gh pr edit "$PR_NUM" --add-reviewer "$reviewer"
   done
   ```

3. **Post mention comment** (single comment listing all `mention` reviewers):
   ```bash
   if [[ ${#MENTION_REVIEWERS[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
     handles=$(printf '%s ' "${MENTION_REVIEWERS[@]}")
     gh pr comment "$PR_NUM" --body "Requesting review from ${handles}— please take a look."
   fi
   ```

### 3. Launch Monitoring Loops

`/loop <interval> <slash-command>` runs a slash command on a recurring interval in the background. Launch CI and review watchers if not already running:

```
/loop 2m /dkwatchci
/loop 5m /dkwatchpr
```

These check status, fix CI failures, address review comments via `/dkprreview`, and cancel themselves when their respective conditions are met (CI green / all reviews approved).

If the user sends a direct prompt during Phase 6, the `UserPromptSubmit` hook pauses these scheduled watcher cycles for `DOYAKEN_WATCH_PAUSE_TTL_SECONDS` (default `60m 0s`). During that pause the watcher skills must skip GitHub/CI commands until the user runs `/dkcomplete` or asks to resume watchers.

Each scheduled watcher invocation is also bounded by `DOYAKEN_WATCH_CYCLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `2m 0s`). If a prior `/dkwatchci` or `/dkwatchpr` cycle is still within that budget, the next scheduled tick must skip without running GitHub/CI commands.

### 4. Wait Window

Each cycle waits at least `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` minutes (default 30) between outcome checks. You don't sleep — you just stop, and the Stop hook re-injects the audit on the next iteration. The audit checks elapsed time and only authorizes outcome evaluation once the window has elapsed.

### 5. Outcome Evaluation (after wait window)

Check overall PR state:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR_NUM"
gh api repos/$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)/pulls/$PR_NUM/reviews
```

- **All CI green AND all configured `request` reviewers approved** → proceed to Step 6 (final verification + close).
- **New commits were pushed** (e.g., `/dkprreview` addressed comments) → re-request reviewers and re-post the mention comment so reviewers know there's something new. Increment cycle, reset wait window.
- **Cycle was idle** (no new commits, no new approvals) → increment cycle. If `cycle_count >= DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES`, escalate to user; otherwise keep waiting.
- **Hard escalation** (3 same-check CI fails, scope change requested, secrets failure, architectural disagreement) → stop and escalate immediately with cited evidence.

### 6. Final Verification

Once Case A in Step 5 is met:

1. **CI**: All checks green (`gh pr checks $PR_NUM` reports all pass).
2. **Reviews**: All `request` reviewers approved, no unresolved comments.
3. **Mention reviewers**: Best-effort — if a `mention` reviewer commented with an actionable concern, it should already have been addressed by `/dkprreview`. The mention reviewers don't gate completion via review state.
4. **Tasks**: All implementation tasks marked completed.

If any condition is not met, return to Step 5 (do not advance to closure).

### 7. Update Ticket

Mark the ticket as Done via the configured tracker (see `doyaken.md § Integrations`). Add a final summary — what was implemented, key decisions, follow-up work. Skip if no tracker configured — the PR is the record.

### 8. Print Summary

```
Ticket: <id> — <title>       (or "No ticket — <branch name>")
URL:    <ticket-url>          (if available)
PR:     <pr-url>
Status: Work complete — awaiting merge (user's decision)

Files changed: X
Lines: +Y / -Z
Commits: N (including N_review review-fix commits)
Tests: M new test cases

Reviews:
  - <reviewer>: <status> (N comments addressed)
  ...

CI: All checks green (X/X passed)
Cycles: <cycle_count>
```

### 9. Signal Completion

After all verification passes and the summary is printed, stop. The Stop hook authorizes completion via the standard `.complete` mechanism — emit `DOYAKEN_TICKET_COMPLETE` only when the hook tells you to.

## Notes

- Do not merge the PR — that's the user's decision (autonomous merging is intentionally out of scope).
- If follow-up work was identified during implementation, mention it in the summary but do not create new tickets unless asked.
- The ticket should be marked "Done" (if a tracker is available) once CI and reviews are green; the actual merge happens when a maintainer accepts the PR.
- Hard escalations (secrets, scope conflict, architectural disagreement, 3+ CI failures on the same check) stop the loop and surface a structured escalation to the user — never auto-resolve these.
