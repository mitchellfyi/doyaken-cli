# Skill: dkreview

Run a single full-scope review wave. Direct user invocations still dispatch to
`/dkreviewloop`; the single-pass mode is for `/dkreviewloop` and Phase 3.

## Dispatch Mode

`/dkreview` without `--single-pass` or `--no-loop` must invoke the Skill tool
with skill: `dkreviewloop`, then stop.

Run the single-pass review-wave instructions only when one of these is true:

- the invocation includes `--single-pass` or `--no-loop`
- the caller explicitly says this is running from `/dkreviewloop`
- the caller explicitly says this is running by `/dkreviewloop`

If unsure, prefer the loop.

## Single-Pass Goal

One single-pass run performs **one full review wave** over the full current
change set:

1. Build or refresh the compact review context pack.
2. Run deterministic checks.
3. Spawn read-only specialist reviewers.
4. Verify, deduplicate, and rank findings.
5. Batch-fix verified findings.
6. Re-check affected surfaces.
7. Write the review result signal.

The outer loop still owns the guarantee of three consecutive full `CLEAN`
passes. A single pass that found and fixed anything is successful engineering
work, but it is **not** a clean pass.

## Review-Wave Contract

Read and follow `prompts/review-wave.md`. It is the source of truth for:

- context-pack contents and path handling
- specialist reviewer roster
- structured JSON-line finding schema
- verifier responsibilities
- result semantics
- stuck-loop findings hash

Use `prompts/review.md` as the criteria library behind each specialist review.
Do not paste the full criteria into every reviewer prompt; point reviewers at the
context pack and the relevant domain.

## Scope Detection

Review the full current change set, not just one category of changes:

- committed branch changes against `origin/<default>...HEAD` when available
- staged changes
- unstaged changes
- untracked files, represented with `git diff --no-index -- /dev/null <file>`

If the caller supplied explicit diff/stat/file-name commands, use those commands
instead of rediscovering scope. They are the authoritative full-scope commands
for the current loop iteration.

If no changes exist, stop with a clear message and do not write `CLEAN`.

## Context Pack

Create or refresh the context pack in global Doyaken loop state:

```bash
source "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/lib/common.sh"
SESSION_ID="${DOYAKEN_SESSION_ID:-$(dk_session_id)}"
REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE="$(dk_review_context_file "$SESSION_ID")"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE")"
```

The pack is shared with specialist reviewers. It must be compact and current,
especially after the orchestrator applies fixes. Materialize it before broad
semantic exploration: write a non-empty skeleton with scope commands, changed
file names, and `Acceptance Criteria: N/A` unless criteria were explicitly
provided by the current caller; then run `test -s "$REVIEW_CONTEXT_FILE"` and
read back the first 80 lines before marking the context-pack step complete.

Do not infer acceptance criteria from stale session prompt files, previous
conversation turns, session titles, AGENTS instructions, or unrelated ticket
context.

## Deterministic Checks

Run deterministic checks before semantic review whenever available and scoped:

- formatter/check mode
- linter/check mode
- typecheck
- targeted tests
- generated-code freshness
- `bash -n`, `zsh -n`, and `shellcheck` for shell changes when available
- CI/workflow/config validation when relevant and available

Fix mechanical failures before semantic review. If any fix is applied, the wave
cannot be `CLEAN`; final result should be `FINDINGS_FIXED:N` or another
non-CLEAN status.

## Specialist Review Wave

Spawn read-only specialist reviewers with the Agent tool. Run them in parallel
when the host supports parallel Agent calls.

If the Agent tool is unavailable, write `BLOCKED:agent-tool-unavailable`. Do not
simulate specialist review by reading all specialist prompts in the orchestrator
context.

Always run:

- `review-correctness`
- `review-security`
- `review-contracts`
- `review-tests`
- `review-architecture`

Run when relevant, allowing quick `N/A` responses:

- `review-frontend`
- `review-devops`
- `review-performance`
- `review-observability`

All specialist reviewers must return `NO_FINDINGS`, `N/A`, or JSON lines in the
schema from `prompts/review-wave.md`.

## Verification

Use `review-verifier` with the Agent tool. If the Agent tool is unavailable,
write `BLOCKED:agent-tool-unavailable`. Verification is mandatory before fixing.

The verifier must:

- deduplicate by root cause
- re-read cited code and context
- reject speculative or stale findings
- reject findings below confidence 50
- confirm the issue is introduced or made relevant by this change
- normalize severity

Only verified findings may drive fixes or reset the clean counter.

## Batch Fix And Recheck

If verified findings exist:

1. Fix them in severity order.
2. Re-run relevant deterministic checks.
3. Re-run targeted review on changed surfaces and impacted callers.
4. If new verified findings appear, fix once more.
5. After two unsuccessful fix cycles, read `prompts/failure-recovery.md`.

Do not mark the wave `CLEAN` after applying fixes. Write `FINDINGS_FIXED:N` when
all verified findings were fixed and rechecked, where N is the number of
verified findings found in the wave.

## Acceptance Criteria

If plan or ticket criteria are available, produce an evidence table:

```markdown
| # | Criterion | Implementation (`file:line`) | Test (`test:line`) | Status |
|---|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------|--------|
```

Any `NOT FOUND`, `NOT MET`, or unverified criterion is a verified finding unless
the criterion is explicitly out of scope or accepted as debt.

If no criteria are available, mark the section `N/A` and continue.

## Result Signal

When `DOYAKEN_SESSION_ID` is available, write exactly one result:

```bash
source "${DOYAKEN_DIR:-$HOME/work/doyaken}/lib/common.sh"
SESSION_ID="${DOYAKEN_SESSION_ID:-$(dk_session_id)}"
echo "<result>" > "$(dk_review_result_file "$SESSION_ID")"
```

Allowed results:

- `CLEAN`
- `FINDINGS_FIXED:N`
- `FINDINGS:N`
- `BLOCKED:reason`

Only `CLEAN` means the wave found zero verified findings and applied zero fixes.

Also append the findings hash described in `prompts/review-wave.md`.

## Final Report

End with:

```markdown
## Review Wave Result

- Scope: full current change set
- Context pack: <path>
- Specialist reviewers: <domains run>
- Deterministic checks: PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL
- Verified findings: N
- Fixes applied this wave: N
- Result signal: CLEAN | FINDINGS_FIXED:N | FINDINGS:N | BLOCKED:reason
```

## Notes

- This skill is for work-in-progress review before verify and PR creation.
- Do not commit, push, create PRs, update PRs, or request external reviewers.
- External PR feedback remains Phase 5/6 and `/dkprreview` work.
