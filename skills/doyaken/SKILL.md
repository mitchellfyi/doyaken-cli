# Skill: Doyaken

Orchestrate the full ticket lifecycle from planning through completion.

## When to Use

- After the SessionStart hook has loaded context and confirmed readiness
- When the user says "doyaken", "start", "go", "begin work", or invokes `/doyaken`

## Lifecycle

The `dk` wrapper runs each phase as a separate Claude Code session, auto-advancing between them. Each phase has an audit loop that critically reviews the work before allowing completion.

### Phase 1: Plan

1. Run `/dkplan` — gather context from the configured tracker (see doyaken.md § Integrations), draft implementation plan, create tasks.
2. **[STOP]** Present the plan to the user. Wait for approval.
3. If the user requests changes, revise and re-present.
4. Output `PHASE_1_COMPLETE` when the user approves.

### Phase 2: Implement

1. **Run any deferred ticket setup first.** Plan mode is read-only, so the bootstrap steps from `prompts/ticket-instructions.md` (branch rename, bootstrap push, draft PR, ticket status → In Progress) cannot run during Phase 1. If they have not already been done, run them now.
2. **Then immediately invoke** the Skill tool with `skill: "dkimplement"` — work through tasks with TDD discipline. Do NOT pause between bootstrap setup and implementation to ask the user for permission; the plan approval was the go-ahead. The user can interrupt at any time if they want to redirect.
3. **[STOP]** if ambiguous requirements, scope changes, or blocked dependencies arise.
4. The audit loop verifies all tasks are complete with tests passing and evidence table filled.
5. **SCOPE**: implementation, testing, and (if not already done) the one-time bootstrap setup from step 1 ONLY. Do NOT commit or push implementation code (Phase 4 owns that), and do NOT update the PR description (Phase 5 owns that).
6. Output `PHASE_2_COMPLETE` when all tasks are implemented and the evidence table shows all criteria MET.

### Phase 3: Review

1. The shell wrapper runs an adversarial review sub-loop — each iteration is a fresh Claude session.
2. Run `/dkreview`, perform 4-pass manual review (Logic, Structure, Security, Holistic), spawn the self-reviewer agent.
3. Build merged findings inventory, fix all issues, write review result signal.
4. The shell tracks consecutive CLEAN results — requires 3 clean passes to advance.
5. **SCOPE**: review and fix ONLY. Do NOT commit, push, or create PRs.
6. Output `PHASE_3_COMPLETE` when review is clean.

### Phase 4: Verify & Commit

1. Run `/dkverify` — format, lint, typecheck, generate, test.
2. Fix any failures. Re-run until all green (max 3 retries per check).
3. Run `/dkcommit` — atomic conventional commits, push to origin.
4. Output `PHASE_4_COMPLETE` when all checks pass and code is pushed.

### Phase 5: PR

1. Run `/dkpr` — generate PR description, create draft PR, attach `request`-type reviewers from `doyaken.md § Reviewers`, update tracker if available.
2. SCOPE: Do NOT mark the PR ready for review or post `@mention` comments — Phase 6 owns those steps so reviewers are notified at exactly the right moment.
3. Output `PHASE_5_COMPLETE` when the draft PR is created and reviewers are attached.

### Phase 6: Complete (autonomous)

1. Read `## Reviewers` from `doyaken.md`. On the first cycle: `gh pr ready`, re-sync `request` reviewers (idempotent), post one `@mention` comment listing all `mention` reviewers.
2. Set up monitoring: `/loop 2m /dkwatchci` and `/loop 5m /dkwatchpr`.
3. Wait at least `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` minutes (default 30) per cycle. The Stop hook re-injects the audit and only authorizes outcome evaluation once the window has elapsed.
4. **[STOP]** if a loop escalates (CI failures after 3 attempts, architectural review comments, secrets scan, scope conflict).
5. After each push: re-request `request` reviewers and post a fresh mention comment so reviewers know there's something new.
6. After `DOYAKEN_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES` (default 3) idle cycles with no progress, escalate to the user.
7. When CI green AND all `request` reviewers have approved, run `/dkcomplete`'s final verification — update tracker to Done, print summary.
8. Output `DOYAKEN_TICKET_COMPLETE` once verification passes.

## Resuming

If the session is interrupted, `dk 999` or `dk --resume` picks up from the saved phase. Phase tracking is handled by the `dk` shell wrapper (see `dk.sh` `__dk_run_phases`), which persists the current phase number in `~/.claude/.doyaken-phases/<session_id>.phase`. The wrapper is responsible for advancing phases and re-launching Claude with the correct phase message and audit prompt.

As a fallback (e.g., when running `/doyaken` interactively without the wrapper), the agent can infer the correct phase by checking current state:

1. **Check for existing PR**: `gh pr view --json state,isDraft,statusCheckRollup`
   - No PR → Phase 1 (Plan)
   - Draft PR, no commits → Phase 1 (Plan)
   - Draft PR with implementation commits → Phase 4 (Verify & Commit)
   - Ready PR with failing CI → Phase 6 (Complete — monitor and fix)
   - Ready PR with all checks green → Phase 6 (Complete — finalize)

2. **Check task list**: If tasks exist from a prior `/dkplan`, offer to resume from the first incomplete task rather than re-planning.

3. **Check ticket state** (if tracker configured):
   - In progress → work underway
   - In review → monitor
   - Done/closed → nothing to do
   - If no tracker: infer from PR and git state above.

## Decision Points Summary

| Phase | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Plan ready | Present plan, wait for approval |
| 2 | Ambiguous requirement | Present options, ask user to choose |
| 2 | Scope change needed | Explain impact, ask approval |
| 5 | Draft PR created | Phase 6 takes over automatically |
| 6 | CI secrets scan failure | Cancel all loops, alert immediately |
| 6 | 3 failed CI fix attempts | Cancel loops, escalate with details |
| 6 | Architectural review comment | Cancel loops, escalate to user |
| 6 | Max cycles reached idle | Escalate to user (no progress) |

## Autonomous Mode (Phase Audit Loops)

When the session is started by `dk`, a Stop hook prevents premature exit and injects a phase-specific audit prompt. Activation is signaled via an `.active` file in `~/.claude/.doyaken-loops/` (and optionally the `DOYAKEN_LOOP_ACTIVE=1` env var as a belt-and-suspenders mechanism). Each phase has its own quality criteria — the loop continues until the audit is satisfied. This enables quality-gated autonomous execution:

- If `/dkverify` fails → fix and retry automatically
- If `/dkreview` finds issues → fix and re-review automatically
- If CI fails → fix and re-push automatically
- If reviews have comments → address and re-push automatically

The loop continues until:
1. **Completion promise**: Output `DOYAKEN_TICKET_COMPLETE` when ALL of these are true:
   - All tasks completed
   - PR merged or approved with all checks green
   - All review comments addressed
   - Ticket updated to Done (if tracker configured)
2. **Max iterations reached** (default: 30) — safety net to prevent runaway costs
3. **User interrupts** — the user can always take over

### When to output the completion promise

Only output `DOYAKEN_TICKET_COMPLETE` when you have verified:
- `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt,statusCheckRollup` shows all checks passed
- No unresolved review threads
- Ticket state is "Done" or "Closed" (if tracker configured)

### Escalation in autonomous mode

Even in autonomous mode, STOP and escalate to the user for:
- Secrets scan failures (never auto-fix)
- Architectural review comments (need human judgement)
- 3+ failed attempts at the same fix
- Scope changes that affect other tickets

## Notes

- The user can interrupt at any point and the agent should gracefully stop.
- Each phase naturally flows into the next — no manual invocation needed after `/doyaken`.
- The agent should provide brief status updates at phase transitions (e.g., "Plan approved. Starting implementation...").
- Keep the configured ticket tracker updated throughout (see doyaken.md § Integrations). If no tracker is configured, the conversation and PR serve as the record.
