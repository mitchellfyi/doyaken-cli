# Skill: Dex

Orchestrate the full ticket lifecycle from planning through completion.

## When to Use

- After the SessionStart hook has loaded context and confirmed readiness
- When the user says "dex", "start", "go", "begin work", or invokes `/dex`

## Lifecycle

The terminal `dx` lifecycle runs phases in the same Claude Code session. Each phase has an audit loop that critically reviews the work before allowing completion; when the phase passes, the Stop hook injects the next phase instructions directly into the current session.

### Phase 0: Setup

1. Runs in NORMAL mode (no plan mode) so the agent can write to git and the tracker before any planning starts.
2. Follow `prompts/ticket-instructions.md` end to end:
   - Read the ticket from the configured tracker (including all comments).
   - If unassigned, assign the ticket to the authenticated user. If assigned to someone else, **[STOP]** and warn.
   - Rename the lifecycle branch to the tracker's git branch name and push it with upstream tracking. Do NOT create a draft PR — Phase 5 owns that step.
   - Set ticket status to **In Progress**.
   - If the description is empty or unclear, draft 2-3 sentences plus an acceptance-criteria checklist, present to the user, and update the ticket once confirmed.
   - Update the per-session meta sidecar with `tracker_key` and `current_branch` so future `dx <N>` invocations can find the worktree even after the branch rename.
3. **SCOPE**: ticket bootstrap only. Do NOT call `EnterPlanMode`, do NOT draft a plan, do NOT write source code, do NOT commit, do NOT open a PR.
4. When setup is complete, write the Phase 0 ready marker (`dx_phase_ready_file ... 0`) and stop once so the Stop hook can audit and advance to Phase 1 automatically.

### Phase 1: Plan

1. Phase 0 already handled ticket setup; do not redo it unless something is clearly missing (status still Backlog/Todo, no assignee, branch not renamed/pushed).
2. Run `/dxplan` — gather any remaining context, draft the implementation plan, create tasks.
3. **[STOP]** Present the plan to the user. Wait for approval.
4. If the user requests changes, revise and re-present.
5. When running under the terminal `dx` lifecycle, stop once immediately after approval so the Stop hook can audit the plan and inject Phase 2 in the same session. Do not tell the user to run `/dximplement`.
6. When running `/dex` interactively without the wrapper, output `PHASE_1_COMPLETE` when the user approves.

### Phase 2: Implement

1. Invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "dximplement"` — work through tasks with TDD discipline. The plan approval was the go-ahead; do not pause to ask for permission.
2. **[STOP]** if ambiguous requirements, scope changes, or blocked dependencies arise.
3. For UI-affecting changes, invoke `/dxuicapture` before UI edits for baseline evidence, then again after implementation. Capture screenshots/traces, record video for interactive flows, and link the `visual-evidence.md` manifest from Dex's artifact directory.
4. The audit loop verifies all tasks are complete with tests passing, evidence table filled, and UI capture evidence present or explicitly N/A.
5. **SCOPE**: implementation, testing, and UI capture evidence ONLY. Ticket setup belongs to Phase 0 — only re-run it here if Phase 0 left it incomplete. Do NOT commit or push implementation code (Phase 4 owns that), and do NOT update the PR description (Phase 5 owns that).
6. Output `PHASE_2_COMPLETE` when all tasks are implemented and the evidence table shows all criteria MET.

### Phase 3: Review

1. Invoke `/dxreviewloop` to run the adaptive adversarial review loop.
2. Each `/dxreviewloop` iteration runs one full review wave in a fresh CLI
   session: compact context pack, deterministic checks, issue harvest, verifier
   triage when needed, batch fixes, and targeted recheck.
3. Waves that find and fix issues write `FINDINGS_FIXED:N`, reset the clean
   counter, and force the next iteration to re-review the full change set.
4. The loop requires the resolved profile's consecutive `CLEAN` gate to advance.
5. **SCOPE**: review and fix ONLY. Do NOT commit, push, or create PRs.
6. Output `PHASE_3_COMPLETE` when review is clean.

### Phase 4: Verify & Commit

1. Run `/dxverify` — format, lint, typecheck, generate, test.
2. Fix any failures. Re-run until all green (max 3 retries per check).
3. Run `/dxcommit` — atomic conventional commits, push to origin.
4. Output `PHASE_4_COMPLETE` when all checks pass and code is pushed.

### Phase 5: PR

1. Run `/dxpr` — generate PR description, refresh any UI after-capture handoff, create draft PR, attach `request`-type reviewers from `dex.md § Reviewers`, update tracker if available.
2. SCOPE: Do NOT mark the PR ready for review or post `@mention` comments — Phase 6 owns those steps so reviewers are notified at exactly the right moment.
3. Output `PHASE_5_COMPLETE` when the draft PR is created and reviewers are attached.

### Phase 6: Complete (autonomous)

1. Read `## Reviewers` from `dex.md`. On the first cycle: `gh pr ready`, re-sync `request` reviewers (idempotent), post one `@mention` comment listing all `mention` reviewers.
2. Set up monitoring: `/loop 5m /dxwatchpr`. The PR watcher handles both CI failures and review feedback.
3. Wait at least `DEX_COMPLETE_WAIT_MINUTES` minutes (default 5) per cycle. The Stop hook re-injects the audit and only authorizes outcome evaluation once the window has elapsed.
4. **[STOP]** if a loop escalates (CI failures after 3 attempts, architectural review comments, secrets scan, scope conflict).
5. After each push: re-request `request` reviewers and post a fresh mention comment so reviewers know there's something new.
6. After `DEX_COMPLETE_MAX_CYCLES` (default 3) idle cycles with no progress, escalate to the user.
7. When CI green AND all `request` reviewers have approved, run `/dxcomplete`'s final verification — update tracker to Done, print summary.
8. Output `DEX_TICKET_COMPLETE` once verification passes.

## Resuming

If the session is interrupted, `dx 999` or `dx --resume` picks up from the saved phase. Phase tracking is handled by the `dx` shell lifecycle (see `dx.sh` `__dx_run_phases`), which persists the current phase number in `~/.claude/.dex-phases/<session_id>.phase`. The Stop hook is responsible for advancing phases in-session by updating phase state and injecting the next phase message and audit prompt.

As a fallback (e.g., when running `/dex` interactively without the wrapper), the agent can infer the correct phase by checking current state:

1. **Check for existing PR**: `gh pr view --json state,isDraft,statusCheckRollup`
   - No PR + branch still on `worktree-ticket-*` or `worktree-task-*` and ticket status is not yet In Progress → Phase 0 (Setup)
   - No PR + bootstrap done (branch renamed, status In Progress) → Phase 1 (Plan)
   - Draft PR, no commits → Phase 1 (Plan)
   - Draft PR with implementation commits → Phase 4 (Verify & Commit)
   - Ready PR with failing CI → Phase 6 (Complete — monitor and fix)
   - Ready PR with all checks green → Phase 6 (Complete — finalize)

2. **Check task list**: If tasks exist from a prior `/dxplan`, offer to resume from the first incomplete task rather than re-planning.

3. **Check ticket state** (if tracker configured):
   - In progress → work underway (Phase 1 or later)
   - In review → monitor
   - Done/closed → nothing to do
   - Backlog/Todo + branch still on the canonical `worktree-*` name → Phase 0 (Setup) still pending
   - If no tracker: infer from PR and git state above.

## Decision Points Summary

| Phase | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Plan ready | Present plan, wait for approval |
| 2 | Ambiguous requirement | Present options, ask user to choose |
| 2 | Scope change needed | Explain impact, ask approval |
| 2-5 | Normal phase completion | Stop once; the Stop hook injects the next phase automatically |
| 5 | Draft PR created | Stop; Phase 6 takes over automatically |
| 6 | CI secrets scan failure | Cancel all loops, alert immediately |
| 6 | 3 failed CI fix attempts | Cancel loops, escalate with details |
| 6 | Architectural review comment | Cancel loops, escalate to user |
| 6 | Max cycles reached idle | Escalate to user (no progress) |

## Autonomous Mode (Phase Audit Loops)

When the session is started by `dx`, a Stop hook prevents premature exit and injects a phase-specific audit prompt. Activation is signaled via an `.active` file in `~/.claude/.dex-loops/` (and optionally the `DEX_LOOP_ACTIVE=1` env var as a belt-and-suspenders mechanism). Each phase has its own quality criteria — the loop continues until the audit is satisfied. This enables quality-gated autonomous execution:

- If `/dxverify` fails → fix and retry automatically
- If `/dxreviewloop` finds issues → fix and re-review automatically
- If CI fails → fix and re-push automatically
- If reviews have comments → address and re-push automatically

The loop continues until:
1. **Completion promise**: Output `DEX_TICKET_COMPLETE` when ALL of these are true:
   - All tasks completed
   - PR approved with all checks green
   - All review comments addressed
   - Ticket updated to Done (if tracker configured)
2. **Max iterations reached** (default: 30) — safety net to prevent runaway costs
3. **User interrupts** — the user can always take over

### When to output the completion promise

Only output `DEX_TICKET_COMPLETE` when you have verified:
- `gh pr view --json state,statusCheckRollup` shows the PR is open/ready and all checks passed
- No unresolved review threads
- Ticket state is "Done" or "Closed" (if tracker configured)

### Escalation in autonomous mode

Even in autonomous mode, STOP and escalate to the user for:
- Secrets scan failures (never auto-fix)
- Architectural review comments (need human judgement)
- 3+ failed attempts at the same fix
- Scope changes that affect other tickets

## Notes

- The user can interrupt at any point and the agent should gracefully stop.
- Each phase naturally flows into the next — no manual invocation needed after `/dex`.
- The agent should provide brief status updates at phase transitions, but must not wait for the user except at the decision points above.
- Keep the configured ticket tracker updated throughout (see dex.md § Integrations). If no tracker is configured, the conversation and PR serve as the record.
